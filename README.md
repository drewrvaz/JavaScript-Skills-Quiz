# JavaScript-Skills-Quiz

## Description
I wanted to create a quiz that would test my skills in both designing it using HTML, CSS, and JS, also in answering some relatively simple questions that could come up during an interview. During this project, I learned a lot about the importance of structuring your HTML.index well so that you can find what you need when styling it and setting up the JS. I also learned a lot about how JS works, and its practical uses in building sites.

## Usage
In order to take the quiz, you need to press the start button. Then you answer a series of questions about JavaScript. At the end of the quiz, you will have an opportunity to enter your score. You can also view your previous high scores by clicking on the View High Scores link in the top left corner. Your score is the amount of time left on the clock when you finish the quiz. Each incorrect answer that you submit subtracts 10 seconds from your time remaining.
